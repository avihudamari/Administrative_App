# Administrative_App

Desktop app manipulate excel files.

In this application I build a UI which gets:
1) specific type of excel files (files that represents a scan test)
2) information filled by the user (year, semester, occurrence and kind)

The system generated a new excel files based on the input files and information received.

There are auxiliary buttons and relevent messages to the user.
